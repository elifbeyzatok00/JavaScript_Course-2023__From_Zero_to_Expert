/*
Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently.

Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one average score per team).

A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team. Otherwise, no team wins!
